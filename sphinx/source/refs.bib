We find that our algorithm can simulate η interacting particles using a number of calculations of the pairwise interactions that scales, for a fixed spatial grid spacing, as , versus the time required by previous methods (assuming the number of orbitals is proportional to η), and scales super-polynomially better with the error tolerance than algorithms based on the Lie–Trotter–Suzuki product formula. Finally, we analyze discretization errors that arise from the spatial grid and show that under some circumstances these errors can remove the exponential speedups typically afforded by quantum simulation.},

We present three techniques for reducing the cost of preparing fermionic Hamiltonian eigenstates using phase estimation. First, we report a polylogarithmic-depth quantum algorithm for antisymmetrizing the initial states required for simulation of fermions in first quantization. This is an exponential improvement over the previous state-of-the-art. Next, we show how to reduce the overhead due to repeated state preparation in phase estimation when the goal is to prepare the ground state to high precision and one has knowledge of an upper bound on the ground state energy that is less than the excited state energy (often the case in quantum chemistry). Finally, we explain how one can perform the time evolution necessary for the phase estimation based preparation of Hamiltonian eigenstates with exactly zero error by using the recently introduced qubitization procedure.},

We present a method for generating physically relevant quantum states on a lattice in real space. In particular, the present algorithm is able to prepare general pure and mixed many-particle states of any number of particles. It relies on a procedure for converting from a second-quantized state to its first-quantized counterpart. The algorithm is efficient in that it operates in time that is polynomial in all the essential descriptors of the system, the number of particles, the resolution of the lattice, and the inverse of the maximum final error. This scaling holds under the assumption that the wave function to be prepared is bounded or its indefinite integral is known and that the Fock operator of the system is efficiently simulatable.},

     abstract={In this paper we study quantum computation from a complexity theoretic viewpoint. Our first result is the existence of an efficient universal quantum Turing machine in Deutsch&#39;s model of a quantum Turing machine (QTM) [Proc. Roy. Soc. London Ser. A, 400 (1985), pp. 97--117]. This construction is substantially more complicated than the corresponding construction for classical Turing machines (TMs); in fact, even simple primitives such as looping, branching, and composition are not straightforward in the context of quantum Turing machines. We establish how these familiar primitives can be implemented and introduce some new, purely quantum mechanical primitives, such as changing the computational basis and carrying out an arbitrary unitary transformation of polynomially bounded dimension. We also consider the precision to which the transition amplitudes of a quantum Turing machine need to be specified. We prove that $O(\log T)$ bits of precision suffice to support a $T$ step computation. This justifies the claim that the quantum Turing machine model should be regarded as a discrete model of computation and not an analog one. We give the first formal evidence that quantum Turing machines violate the modern (complexity theoretic) formulation of the Church--Turing thesis. We show the existence of a problem, relative to an oracle, that can be solved in polynomial time on a quantum Turing machine, but requires superpolynomial time on a bounded-error probabilistic Turing machine, and thus not in the class $\BPP$. The class $\BQP$ of languages that are efficiently decidable (with small error-probability) on a quantum Turing machine satisfies $\BPP \subseteq \BQP \subseteq \Ptime^{\SP}$. Therefore, there is no possibility of giving a mathematical proof that quantum Turing machines are more powerful than classical probabilistic Turing machines (in the unrelativized setting) unless there is a major breakthrough in complexity theory.},

We then sketch how results of interest, like the energy spectrum of a system, can be obtained. We also indicate that ultimately the simulation of quantum field theory might be possible on large quantum computers. We want to demonstrate that in principle various interesting things can be done. Actual applications will have to be worked out in detail also depending on what kind of quantum computer may be available one day... 1 Quantum Computers (QCs) Quantum computers are still imaginary devices, but it is hoped that eventually the technical problems involved in their realization can be overcome [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Quantum computers could solve some problems much faster than conventional computers. Most prominently, Peter Shor (1994) has given a &#34;quantum algorithm&#34; for factoring large integers in polynomial time [8](see also [2]). A l-bit quantum computer may be thought of consisting of l two-state systems. Computations would be carried out by inducing unitary transformations of a few at a time of these quantum-bits (qubits). This may be done by exterior fields controlled from the outside. Upon observation at the end of the &#34;unitary computation&#34; the quantum computer would collapse into a state where each qubit is either a 0 or a 1. The art of finding a &#34;quantum algorithm&#34; is to extract useful information from a few such runs. The main technical problem in realizing QCs is, to prevent unwanted interactions with the environment during the calculation. Such interactions can cause decoherence, such that the QC is no longer in a pure quantum state. Here we consider an idealized QC which doesn&#39;t suffer from such problems.},

Interest in quantum computation has since been growing. One of the main difficulties in realizing quantum computation is that decoherence tends to destroy the information in a superposition of states in a quantum computer, making long computations impossible. A further difficulty is that inaccuracies in quantum state transformations throughout the computation accumulate, rendering long computations unreliable. However, these obstacles may not be as formidable as originally believed. For any quantum computation with t gates, we show how to build a polynomial size quantum circuit that tolerates O(1 / log c t) amounts of inaccuracy and decoherence per gate, for some constant c; the previous bound was O(1 /t). We do this by showing that operations can be performed on quantum data encoded by quantum error-correcting codes without decoding this data.},

     abstract={Combining two systems: the tensor productThe state of a quantum system is a vector in a complex vector space. (Technically, if the dimension of the vector space is infinite, then it is a separable Hilbert space.) Here we will always assume that our systems are finite-dimensional. We do this because everything we will discuss transfers without change to infinite-dimensional systems. Further, when one actually simulates a system on a computer, one must always truncate an infinite-dimensional space so that it is finite.Consider two separate quantum systems. Now consider the fact that if we take them together, then we should be able to describe them as one big quantum system. That is, instead of describing them by two separate state vectors, one for each system, we should be able to represent the states of both of them together using one single state vector. (This state vector will naturally need to have more elements in it than the separate state-vectors for each of the systems, and we will work out exactly how many below.) In fact, in order to describe a situation in which the two systems have affected each other – by interacting in some way – and have become correlated with each other as a result of this interaction, we will need to go beyond using a separate state vector for each. If each system is in a pure state, described by a state vector for it alone, then there are no correlations between the two systems. Using a single state vector to describe the joint state of the two systems is the natural way to describe all possible states that the two systems could be in (correlated or uncorrelated). We now show how this is done.},

     abstract =       {Practical challenges in simulating quantum systems on classical computers have been widely recognized in the quantum physics and quantum chemistry communities over the past century. Although many approximation methods have been introduced, the complexity of quantum mechanics remains hard to appease. The advent of quantum computation brings new pathways to navigate this challenging complexity landscape. By manipulating quantum states of matter and taking advantage of their unique features such as superposition and entanglement, quantum computers promise to efficiently deliver accurate results for many important problems in quantum chemistry such as the electronic structure of molecules. In the past two decades significant advances have been made in developing algorithms and physical hardware for quantum computing, heralding a revolution in simulation of quantum systems. This article is an overview of the algorithms and results that are relevant for quantum chemistry. The intended audience is both quantum chemists who seek to learn more about quantum computing, and quantum computing researchers who would like to explore applications in quantum chemistry.},

Quantum computing algorithms for the quantum simulation of these systems have recently witnessed remarkable growth, notwithstanding the limitations of existing quantum hardware, especially as a tool for electronic structure computations in molecules. In this review, we provide a self‐contained introduction to emerging algorithms for the simulation of Hamiltonian dynamics and eigenstates, with emphasis on their applications to the electronic structure in molecular systems. Theoretical foundations and implementation details of the method are discussed, and their strengths, limitations, and recent advances are presented.

This paper considers a different approach to the problem, by studying the problem of &#39;quantum state generation&#39;. We first show that any problem in Statistical Zero Knowledge (including eg. discrete log, quadratic residuosity and gap closest vector in a lattice) can be reduced to an instance of the quantum state generation problem. Having shown the generality of the state generation problem, we set the foundations for a new paradigm for quantum state generation. We define &#39;Adiabatic State Generation&#39; (ASG) , which is based on Hamiltonians instead of unitary gates. We develop tools for ASG including a very general method for implementing Hamiltonians (The sparse Hamiltonian lemma), and ways to guarantee non negligible spectral gaps (The jagged adiabatic path lemma). We also prove that ASG is equivalent in power to state generation in the standard quantum model. After setting the foundations for ASG, we show how to apply our techniques to generate interesting superpositions related to Markov chains. The ASG approach to quantum algorithms provides intriguing links between quantum computation and many different areas: the analysis of spectral gaps and groundstates of Hamiltonians in physics, rapidly mixing Markov chains, statistical zero knowledge, and quantum random walks. We hope that these links will bring new insights and methods into quantum algorithms.},

     abstract={In evaluating some low temperature (T<1000 K) thermal rate coefficients for inelastic rotational excitation of H2 by H atoms, Sun and Dalgarno have found a marked sensitivity to the potential energy surface adopted for the calculations. We have investigated the origin of the discrepancies between previous H3 potential energy surfaces and have developed a refined surface which addresses these concerns. New quasiclassical trajectory calculations of cross sections for low energy rotational excitation are reported. The refined surface is based on 8701 ab initio energies, most newly computed for this purpose. It has the same functional form as our earlier (BKMP) surface, but since the fit of the parameters is more fully constrained than for any previous surface it is a more accurate representation. The refined surface matches the ab initio energies with an overall rms error of 0.27 mEh (i.e., 0.17 kcal/mol) and a maximum absolute deviation of 6.2 mEh (for a very compact high energy equilateral triangle conformation). For ‘‘noncompact’’ conformations (no interatomic distance smaller than 1.15 bohr), the rms error is 0.18 mEh and the maximum absolute deviation is 1.7 mEh. The refined surface is compared critically to four previous surfaces, including the DMBE surface of Varandas et al., in several respects: Legendre expansion coefficients; the interaction region for low energy rotational excitation; near the collinear saddle point; near conical intersections of the ground and first excited state surfaces; the van der Waals well; and compact geometries. We have also compared new first excited state ab initio energies for 1809 conformations with corresponding predictions from the DMBE surface.},

     abstract={In this paper we study quantum computation from a complexity theoretic viewpoint. Our first result is the existence of an efficient universal quantum Turing machine in Deutsch&#39;s model of a quantum Turing machine (QTM) [Proc. Roy. Soc. London Ser. A, 400 (1985), pp. 97--117]. This construction is substantially more complicated than the corresponding construction for classical Turing machines (TMs); in fact, even simple primitives such as looping, branching, and composition are not straightforward in the context of quantum Turing machines. We establish how these familiar primitives can be implemented and introduce some new, purely quantum mechanical primitives, such as changing the computational basis and carrying out an arbitrary unitary transformation of polynomially bounded dimension. We also consider the precision to which the transition amplitudes of a quantum Turing machine need to be specified. We prove that $O(\log T)$ bits of precision suffice to support a $T$ step computation. This justifies the claim that the quantum Turing machine model should be regarded as a discrete model of computation and not an analog one. We give the first formal evidence that quantum Turing machines violate the modern (complexity theoretic) formulation of the Church--Turing thesis. We show the existence of a problem, relative to an oracle, that can be solved in polynomial time on a quantum Turing machine, but requires superpolynomial time on a bounded-error probabilistic Turing machine, and thus not in the class $\BPP$. The class $\BQP$ of languages that are efficiently decidable (with small error-probability) on a quantum Turing machine satisfies $\BPP \subseteq \BQP \subseteq \Ptime^{\SP}$. Therefore, there is no possibility of giving a mathematical proof that quantum Turing machines are more powerful than classical probabilistic Turing machines (in the unrelativized setting) unless there is a major breakthrough in complexity theory.},

This scheme is applied to the photodissociation of NOCl after excitation to the S1 surface. The results are compared to the results of an exact wave‐packet dynamics calculation. Fast convergence of the MCTDH results toward the exact one is found as the number of configurations is increased. The computation times of the MCTDH calculations are found to be much shorter than those of the exact calculation. Even MCTDH calculations including sufficiently many configurations for a fully converged (quasiexact) description require over two orders of magnitude less CPU time than an exact calculation. The so‐called ‘‘natural populations’’ that are computed along with the MCTDH wave packet serve as a check of the degree of convergence without the need to resort to an exact (or more accurate) calculation.},

Conventional methods for solving this problem rely on diagonalization of a Hamiltonian matrix or iterative numerical solutions of a time independent wave equation. The new method, in contrast, is based on the spectral properties of solutions to the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. The method requires the computation of a correlation function 〈ψ(r, 0)| ψ(r, t)〉 from a numerical solution ψ(r, t). Fourier analysis of this correlation function reveals a set of resonant peaks that correspond to the stationary states of the system. Analysis of the location of these peaks reveals the eigenvalues with high accuracy. Additional Fourier transforms of ψ(r, t) with respect to time generate the eigenfunctions. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated for a one-dimensional asymmetric double well potential and for the two-dimensional Hénon-Heiles potential.},

     abstract={The computational cost of exact methods for quantum simulation using classical computers grows exponentially with system size. As a consequence, these techniques can be applied only to small systems. By contrast, we demonstrate that quantum computers could exactly simulate chemical reactions in polynomial time. Our algorithm uses the split-operator approach and explicitly simulates all electron-nuclear and interelectronic interactions in quadratic time. Surprisingly, this treatment is not only more accurate than the Born-Oppenheimer approximation but faster and more efficient as well, for all reactions with more than about four atoms. This is the case even though the entire electronic wave function is propagated on a grid with appropriately short time steps. Although the preparation and measurement of arbitrary states on a quantum computer is inefficient, here we demonstrate how to prepare states of chemical interest efficiently. We also show how to efficiently obtain chemically relevant observables, such as state-to-state transition probabilities and thermal reaction rates. Quantum computers using these techniques could outperform current classical computers with 100 qubits.},
